# Important
- The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
- This project was originally designed by Udacity for the React Nanodegree's project.
- It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
